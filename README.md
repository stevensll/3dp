* * Note the comment about flashing: 
* * > Seems to be important to Reformat the SD card in FAT32 with 4k allocations to really make sure it's empty and readable. I did a full format the first time as the allocation was different and quick formats after that. Also if a firmware update fails and you get a blank screen try changing the bin file's name slightly before you try again. It seems it won't read in a bin if it's the same as the one it last saw.
